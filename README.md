# APRSDataStorage
## Program for fetching and storing data from callsigns.

Built using the [APRS.fi API](https://aprs.fi/page/api).

To use:

- Type the callsign in the callsign box. 
- Edit the interval (in seconds) for the data to be retrieved and stored (or keep it at the default 1 minute).
- Press generate to start producing and saving the data.
- The data will be saved in an excel file with the title [callsign].xlsx in your documents folder on your computer.

Thanks.
